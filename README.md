# Honors Single Variable Calculus

For two semesters, Fall 2017 \& 2018, I taught an accelerated honors single variable calculus course at JHU.
The course covers two semesters worth of calculus (integration and differentiation) in one semester.
The course is designed in an IBL-format - you're expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject.
The first iteration of the notes contain only problems and is quite challenging.
The second iteration contains more theory and explanations and is relatively easier to follow.
The prerequisites are pre-calculus.
It is recommended to have done an introductory course on basic calculus and have some exposure to mathematical proofs before using these notes.
